Qidame Gebeya isn't just about selling goods; it's about telling stories, fostering connections, and preserving traditions. Through this platform, I aim to provide artisans, producers, and entrepreneurs with a platform to reach a global audience, while offering consumers an opportunity to discover and support authentic Ethiopian products.

One of the most significant technical challenges I faced during the development of Qidame Gebeya was implementing secure user authentication and authorization. Ensuring that user data remained protected while providing a seamless and user-friendly experience was paramount.
I chose to integrate Supabase for authentication due to its comprehensive features and seamless integration with React. However, navigating the complexities of token management, error handling, and routing proved to be daunting tasks. Despite encountering several roadblocks along the way, I persevered and sought assistance from online forums and community support channels to troubleshoot and resolve the issues.
In the end, I successfully implemented Supabase authentication into our application, enabling users to securely create accounts, log in, and access personalized features. This experience not only strengthened my technical skills but also reinforced my commitment to delivering secure and user-centric solutions.
Looking ahead, I envision expanding Qidame Gebeya to include features such as real-time chat support, personalized recommendations, and enhanced product visualization. Additionally, I plan to optimize the platform for mobile devices and explore opportunities for international shipping to further broaden its reach.
But beyond the technical enhancements, my ultimate goal is to continue fostering a sense of community and pride among Ethiopians while sharing our rich cultural heritage with the world.
